/**
 * The one holder of the per-owner account-mode record, and the lock the legacy
 * write seals share with the On latch.
 *
 * - `read` is synchronous and never waits: before the first answer it is
 *   `unknown` (reads stay legacy, legacy writes pause), after it `streams` or
 *   `legacy`.
 * - `submitEvidence` takes the lock exclusively, saves the new record, then
 *   publishes it. A save that fails throws and changes nothing in memory.
 * - `commitLegacy` takes the lock shared and reads the record inside it with no
 *   await before the write starts. An On therefore waits for every legacy
 *   write already running, and no legacy write starts after it. This is the
 *   commit fence: a check made before the lock is only an early refusal.
 * - A write run under `commitLegacy` or `commitRemoval` must not call either
 *   again: the inner call would wait behind a queued On that waits for it.
